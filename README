Collectd-Plugins-OpenAFS

This collectd plugin will use the openafs command line helpers to query statistics.
Currently it ships with CLI wrapper classes L<AFS::VOS> and L<AFS::VLDB>, as the XS modules that are available on CPAN are troublesome to build, especially using recent versions of openafs. This will happily change in the future, if the latter product is improving.
